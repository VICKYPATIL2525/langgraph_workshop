## 🔑 Key Concepts

### State
A TypedDict that defines data flowing through the graph. Persists across all nodes.

```python
class BlogState(TypedDict):
    title: str       # Input
    outline: str     # Generated by first node
    content: str     # Generated by second node
```

### Node
A function that processes the state and returns updates.

```python
def generate_outline(state: BlogState) -> BlogState:
    title = state['title']
    outline = llm.invoke(f"Create outline for: {title}")
    state['outline'] = outline
    return state
```

### Edge
Connection between nodes defining execution flow.

```python
graph.add_edge(START, 'outline_generator')
graph.add_edge('outline_generator', 'content_generator')
graph.add_edge('content_generator', END)
```

### Workflow
Compiled, executable version of the graph.

```python
workflow = graph.compile()
result = workflow.invoke(initial_state)
```

### Parallel Execution
Multiple nodes starting from the same predecessor.

```python
# All three nodes run simultaneously
graph.add_edge(START, "grammar")
graph.add_edge(START, "sentiment")
graph.add_edge(START, "clarity")
```

### Conditional Routing
Branching based on state values.

```python
def decide_next(state):
    if state['sentiment'] == "positive":
        return "thank"
    else:
        return "apology"

graph.add_conditional_edges("check", decide_next, ...)
```

### Exercise 2: Extend Q&A
Add a **follow-up question node** to `test1_commented_v1.py`.

### Exercise 3: Add Blog Editor
Create a new `editor` node in `test2.py` to improve generated content.

### Exercise 4: New Analysis Dimension
Add an **originality analysis** node parallel to others in `test3.py`.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'langgraph'"
**Solution**: Activate virtual environment and install dependencies
```bash
myenv\Scripts\activate
pip install langgraph langchain langchain-openai
```

### Issue: Azure OpenAI connection errors
**Solution**: Check `.env` file
```bash
# Verify these are set correctly:
# OPENAI_API_KEY
# AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT
# AZURE_OPENAI_VERSION
```

### Issue: MongoDB connection refused
**Solution**: Start MongoDB server
```bash
mongod
```

### Issue: LLM returns non-JSON in planner
**Solution**: Increase prompt clarity in `multisource_langgraph.py`
```python
prompt = "Respond with ONLY valid JSON, NO other text..."
```

### Issue: Infinite loop in test5
**Solution**: Auto-approval is implemented after 3 attempts by default
